# House-Prediction-Model
Here is my first ever Supervised Machine learning project. 
In this project, we'll predict future house prices.
We'll use data from the Federal Reserve, along with house price data from Zillow. 
We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model. 
The model will predict if house prices will increase or decrease in the future. 
We'll measure error using backtesting, then improve our model with new predictors.
This project can be customized to predict house prices in the USA.
